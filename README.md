## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This is the first project of the [**Udacity Data Scientist NanoDegree Program**](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

For this project, I will follow the CRISP-DM process to create a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of my own. 

CRISP-DM/Cross Industry Process for Data Minning:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The `Anaconda Distribution` should contain all the necessary libraries used in the project. I have listed the libraries below as additional information.

1. Mac or Windows System
2. [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/index.html)
3. Libraries:
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Ipython, Scikit-Learn

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I used open data from [Airbnb Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) and [Airbnb Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) to understand the following questions: 

1. How much Airbnb homes are earning in different neighbourhoods and seasons in Boston and Seattle?
2. How do different features affect prices in Airbnb listings?
3. How well can we predict the price with a Linear Regression model?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Raw Data:
-  BostonAirbnbOpenData Folder
- SeattleAirbnbOpenData Folder

Notebook for Analysis:
- Project I - Airbnb Boston & Seattle Data Analysis.ipynb
- Project I - Airbnb Boston & Seattle Data Analysis.html

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found in the post available on [Medium Platform](https://medium.com/@nanlii/hows-airbnb-doing-in-boston-and-seattle-33dab6e875df).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree Program, and I'm using Airbnb open data. 

Thank you Udacity and Airbnb! :love_you_gesture:
